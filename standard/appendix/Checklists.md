# OWASP APTS Compliance Checklists

Informative Appendix (non-normative)

This appendix is part of the OWASP Autonomous Penetration Testing Standard (APTS). It organizes all 174 tier-required requirements by domain and compliance tier so that platform operators (vendors, service providers, and enterprise security teams) and customers can quickly identify what must be satisfied for each tier within each domain. All requirements referenced here are defined in the domain READMEs, which are the authoritative source. Advisory practices (identifiers of the form `APTS-<DOMAIN>-A0x`) live in the [Advisory Requirements appendix](Advisory_Requirements.md) and are not included in tier conformance.

**How to use:** For your target compliance tier, satisfy all requirements at that tier **and all lower tiers** within each domain. Tier 2 includes all Tier 1 requirements; Tier 3 includes all Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements.

**Notation:** Each requirement is marked **MUST** (mandatory) or **SHOULD** (recommended). Both MUST and SHOULD requirements must be satisfied for tier conformance. No partial credit.

- [ ] **APTS-TP-010** | MUST | Select vulnerability feeds assessing CVE coverage/update frequency/data quality/SLA, verify cryptographic signatures, test quality before production, and track modifications.
- [ ] **APTS-TP-011** | SHOULD | Validate feeds against discovered services with confidence scoring, maintain test datasets measuring false negatives, document quality targets, and establish severity-based incident procedures.
- [ ] **APTS-TP-015** | MUST | Document retention periods per classification with justification, maintain inventory with expiration dates and 30-day automated reminders, use appropriate deletion methods, and verify with failed recovery tests.
- [ ] **APTS-TP-017** | MUST | Deploy isolated execution environment per engagement (container/VM/namespace) with separate storage/network/credentials, engagement-scoped encryption keys and credential vaults, segregated logs, and monthly penetration tests.
- [ ] **APTS-TP-019** | MUST | Document model source/supplier, training data categories, fine-tuning history, and verify models not retrained on other customers' data without disclosure and consent.
- [ ] **APTS-TP-020** | SHOULD | Inventory all persistent state across engagements (embeddings, RAG indexes, cached context), enforce cross-engagement isolation, enable operator inspection/export/purge, and audit decision influence.
- [ ] **APTS-TP-007** | SHOULD | Document data residency requirements and verify provider configurations enforce jurisdictional constraints on data storage and transfers.
- [ ] **APTS-TP-022** | MUST | Re-attest scope enforcement (SE), safety controls (SC), manipulation resistance (MR), and graduated autonomy (AL) whenever the foundation model undergoes a material change (provider change, family change, generation boundary cross, fine-tune or adapter change, or documented capability shift); block promotion of the new model to production engagements until the re-attestation workpaper is complete.

### Tier 3 (1 Requirement)

- [ ] **APTS-TP-016** | MUST | Generate data destruction certificates documenting destroyed data, methods, timestamps, cryptographic verification, and independent verification of inaccessibility; support customer-initiated destruction within SLA.

## 8. Reporting (RP) --- 15 Requirements

### Tier 1 (3 Requirements)

- [ ] **APTS-RP-006** | MUST | Disclose the platform's false positive rate methodology and measurements in every report, including overall and engagement-specific rates, flagging if rates exceed published targets.
- [ ] **APTS-RP-008** | MUST | Include a Coverage Matrix identifying specific vulnerability classes tested, excluded, and partially covered, mapped to CWE categories with detection methods documented.
- [ ] **APTS-RP-011** | MUST | Include an executive summary for non-technical stakeholders with overall risk posture, severity breakdown, key findings with business impact, scope coverage percentage, and clear language.
- [ ] **APTS-RP-016** | MUST | Implement automated finding authenticity verification that screens each finding for fabricated evidence, hallucinated vulnerabilities, and severity misclassification before human review, operating independently of the discovering agent.

### Tier 2 (10 Requirements)

- [ ] **APTS-RP-001** | MUST | Include raw technical evidence (packet captures, HTTP pairs, command output, screenshots, file contents) for every finding, clearly separated from AI-generated summaries, flagging findings without raw evidence as "Unverified."
- [ ] **APTS-RP-002** | MUST | Finding Verification and Human Review Pipeline - Attempt automated reproduction of every Critical and High finding before final report, logging all attempts with timestamps and marking findings as "Confirmed" or "Unconfirmed," with re-verification and human review included.
- [ ] **APTS-RP-003** | MUST | Calculate confidence scores (0-100%) for each finding using documented, measurable factors (reproductions, evidence quality, attack path complexity) with a consistent auditable formula.
- [ ] **APTS-RP-004** | MUST | Document complete provenance chain for each finding tracing discovery to specific scanner execution with SHA-256 cryptographic hashing for tamper prevention.
